# Summary
Maharashtra consists of industrial cities like Nagpur, Mumbai which lead to high pollution. This pollution poses a high risk to life. In this project, we want to find relation between health and various pollution indicators. We compare the pollution levels of Maharashtra to that of other regions and find the regions of Maharashtra which are prone to health hazards due to pollution. 
TO conclude, we suggest gathering dataset to analyse the dependence of health on high level of pollution in Maharashtra
